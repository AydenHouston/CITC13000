                <p> The pokemon tcg is a intresting game that i have personally invested some hours into playing and trying to understand the game and i personally find everything intresting about it their is mutiple things that can happen in a match and using a lot of card but first let me explaun the basics of the game you first start out with a deck of 60 cards and their are three catagorys that can define cards pokemon,trainer and enegry  almost every pokemon card needs to use a energy to attack  </p>

                <p> The tcg game has had muttiple gimicks thorughtout its life time and each of them have some kind of tie in with other parts of the franchaise but the one i want to focus on is the V and VStar v pokemon are very strong but a downside is if they die your opeenant takes 2 prize cards instead of one for the game this is risk as they can take a long tinme to set up but vstars have a orignal abilty that can only be used once per turn for example the dialga v star abilty allows him to attack back to back and allowing you gain a serious advantage if you plan with this abilty in mind.</p>
